### Day 0: February 18, 2021
**Hello World** & **Arithmetic Master Py Edition**

**Progress:**
HelloWorld.py got a little out of hand I experimented with
 - ``print()`` statements (naturally, it is a HelloWorld after all)
 - Variables: ``x = 5`` ``howdyPlanet = 'Howdy Planet'``
 - String concats: ``print(howdyPlanet + helloWorld)``
 - ``for:`` statements
 - random module
 - User input (ITS THAT EASY?)

ArithmeticMasterPyEd.py was more tame. All the statements mentioned above made it real easy to work out. I only have a couple issues which I could solve today but I miss the sun:
TO-DO (haha I too am a programmer):
 - ``if userAns == Ans`` doesn't recognise when both variable match?
 - Division. I'll figure out a way to make it generate numbers which can be divided evenly.
 - Perhaps give the user a way to end the while loop too.

**Thoughts:**
PYTHON DOES NOT REQUIRE SEMI-COLONS. NOBODY TOLD ME THIS. After I managed to get it working on Windows, it hit me in the face just how simple Python is, I'm going to have more issues figuring out what to do with it than I am with actually doing the things. 
I also feel I have abused ``if`` statements in ArithmeticMasterPyEd.py. I'll look at making a cleaner version 2.

**Work:**
