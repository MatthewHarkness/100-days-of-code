# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Example Log (For personal reference):
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

Actual Human Log:

### Day 0: February 18, 2021
**Hello World** & **Arithmetic Master Py Edition**

**Progress:**
HelloWorld.py got a little out of hand I experimented with
 - ``print()`` statements (naturally, it is a HelloWorld after all)
 - Variables: ``x = 5`` ``howdyPlanet = 'Howdy Planet'``
 - String concats: ``print(howdyPlanet + helloWorld)``
 - ``for:`` statements
 - random module
 - User input (ITS THAT EASY?)

ArithmeticMasterPyEd.py was more tame. All the statements mentioned above made it real easy to work out. I only have a couple issues which I could solve today but I miss the sun:
TO-DO (haha I too am a programmer):
 - ``if userAns == Ans`` doesn't recognise when both variable match?
 - Division. I'll figure out a way to make it generate numbers which can be divided evenly.
 - Perhaps give the user a way to end the while loop too.

**Thoughts:**
PYTHON DOES NOT REQUIRE SEMI-COLONS. NOBODY TOLD ME THIS. After I managed to get it working on Windows, it hit me in the face just how simple Python is, I'm going to have more issues figuring out what to do with it than I am with actually doing the things. 
I also feel I have abused ``if`` statements in ArithmeticMasterPyEd.py. I'll look at making a cleaner version 2.
